With the increase of data, traditional machine learning models reach a bottleneck in their performance at one point. Hence we developed neural networks.

Advantage of ReLU compared to Sigmoid is, relu is much more faster since it converges to 0 more quickly than sigmoid does. Parameters in gradient descent change slowly for sigmoid compared to relu.
